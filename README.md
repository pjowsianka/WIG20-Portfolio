# WIG20 Portfolio Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (WIG20 Portfolio.ipynb) that demonstrates portfolio analysis of the WIG20 index, using the concepts of Sharp ratio and Monte Carlo simulation.


## Introduction
The WIG20 Portfolio Analysis notebook focuses on constructing an optimal portfolio from the WIG20 index based on the Sharpe ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted return. It also includes a Monte Carlo simulation to analyze the potential future performance of the portfolio.

## Notebook Overview
The notebook is structured as follows:
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the data for analysis, including handling missing values and adjusting for stock splits or dividends.
2. Portfolio Construction: Constructs a portfolio using the stocks from the WIG20 index and calculates various metrics, including the Sharpe ratio, for each combination.
3. Optimal Portfolio Selection: Identifies the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio as the optimal portfolio.
4. Monte Carlo Simulation: Performs a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the future performance of the optimal portfolio under different scenarios.
5. Visualization: Presents visualizations of the portfolio analysis results and simulation outcomes.
